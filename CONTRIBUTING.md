### New Blog Post
Creating a blog post is not too hard.
Jekyll has full markdown support, something you can read more about [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

A blog post has to start with this:
```
---
layout: post
title:  "The best title you can come up with!"
date:   2018-01-01 01:00:00 +0100
categories: software
author: Me!
---
Your post content then goes here, markdown is enabled!
```
A post *must* start with a layout, title and date. A category or author is not required, but it's certainly neat to have.
Note that the author will be displayed on the published post.

You can submit a file or just plain text, it doesn't really matter.
The important thing is that you always create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Mnpn03/I-Hate-Restrictions-Online/pulls)!
A file must follow the naming scheme of `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.markdown`, and it should be put in the `/_posts` directory.

**Quick checklist:**
- Make sure you're writing about something that others can relate to.
- Can others understand what you're trying to say? Ensure decent grammar. We know it's hard to write in a foreign language if you're not a native speaker, but try to make your post understandable, and we'll help you with the rest. Do Not Type Like This, It Gets Very Annoying.
- Is my content safe? Make sure your post does not include any NSFW content, such as porn or gore as that's disgusting. Also, make sure you don't post links to malicious sites.
- Is my content nice? Avoid racism and nazism. It's completely unrelated to our blog, and you should ensure that your content is nice to everyone in the community.
- Does my post fit in with the theme of the blog? Talking about your cat driving a car isn't ranting about software, restrictions or other various technical items.

If you have submitted your post without following these guidelines, the Pull Request will most likely be closed.

So, how long will it take for my post to get reviewed?

Was that a lot to take in at once? Thanks to you the blog expands with great creative rants written by all of you. That's some dedication!

### Pull Requests
PRs aren't just for new posts! If you find any kind of flaw, design error or if you've just come up with a great idea and you're willing to submit it, then please do!
If your PR has resolved an issue, please state which one by tagging it with it's ID: `#55`.

### Issues
Create an issue if you want to let us know of any problems, but you don't feel, know or want to fix it yourself by [submitting a Pull Request](#pull-requests).
Please clearly state what the issue is, e.g. if it's grammatical, a design flaw, an idea, etc.
