Two days ago I wanted to watch a movie!

First, most obvious thing: Check Netflix.
Good news! It's on Netfli- oh hey what's this?
It's only on Netflix US. Go figure.

Second: Check Google Play Movies. It has all kinds of movies
and I've honestly never seen a movie that's not sold there.
Most movies are rentable for really cheap as well, which is pretty great!

This movie is rentable... in the US. In Sweden you have to buy it.
This is where I seriously consider if I should watch it at all.
In the US I could rent this for $2 but since I'm here I have to buy it for $13...
As if that wasn't enough, the movie was also applicable for tax.
And the Swedish VAT is quite high: 25%. At this point it's more of a WAT than VAT.

The final price for this one single movie was $16.
In the US I could have gotten it for free, or at the maximum of $2.

The worst part about this is that I'm still a kid and am *lucky* to even get $20 a month.  
For other children that don't get free money from their parents every month? God help them.  
*And people wonder why the pirating rates for movies are so high..*
