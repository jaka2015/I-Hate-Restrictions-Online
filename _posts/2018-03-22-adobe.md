### Adobe Software.
Sorry, what? Excuse me?

One Adobe program is 240 SEK in Sweden and 164 SEK in the US. $20, no VAT; 192kr, 25% VAT. See the difference?

So how about a student discount? All programs would be 195 SEK/month. The US? 80 SEK. 80. Student discount is applied for one year. One. You'll have to pay full price after that. How can you be "creative [cloud]" if you can't afford the software as a student?

What if you're not even a student?

*Adobe, please.*
